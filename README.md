# Plant Disease Recognition Using Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow in Google Colab to classify plant leaf images as healthy or diseased.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib
- PlantVillage Dataset

## Features
- Data preprocessing: resizing, normalization, augmentation
- CNN architecture with high validation accuracy
- Visualization of results and confusion matrix

## Dataset
- PlantVillage dataset from Kaggle: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)

## Run it in Google Colab
