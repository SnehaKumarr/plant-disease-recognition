# Plant Disease Recognition Using Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow in Google Colab to classify plant leaf images as healthy or diseased.

## Tech Stack

### Technologies Used:

1. **Deep Learning Framework**
   - `TensorFlow / Keras` – Used to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying plant leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.

2. **Development Environment**
   - `Google Colab` – Utilized for model development and training, taking advantage of free cloud GPUs.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - `Matplotlib` – Used to visualize training curves, prediction outputs, and model evaluation metrics.

4. **Programming Language**
   - `Python` – Used for writing the entire pipeline including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: resizing, normalization, augmentation
- CNN architecture with high validation accuracy
- Visualization of results and confusion matrix

## Dataset
- PlantVillage dataset from Kaggle: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
